Watch for new captures from the SeeWhatISee Chrome extension. Each time a capture arrives, process it as described below, then watch for the next one. Keep looping until the user tells you to stop, or until a failure.

To look for older captures (the last few, by date or time, by site, or by text), use the `see-what-i-see-history` skill.

**If anything fails, do not try to debug or fix anything. Just report the failure.**

**Do not read the script.** Just run it, following the instructions below.

This is a **loop of single-shot runs**: each run of `./scripts/watch-once.sh` waits for the next capture, prints one JSON record, and exits — so you re-run it once per capture.

The run happens in the background, so the user can keep prompting you while it waits. Stay responsive to them between captures; just come back to the record when the run finishes.

## Getting captures in a loop

1. **Wait for the next capture.** Run `./scripts/watch-once.sh` (relative to this skill's directory), with no timeout. It waits until a capture arrives, then prints one JSON record to stdout and exits. **Wait for it to complete before going on to step 2** — but keep answering the user in the meantime.

2. **Check the exit code.**
   - **3 (stopped on request):** tell the user the watch was stopped — stderr says whether that was a stop request or another watcher taking over — and do NOT restart.
   - **Other non-zero (killed or errored):** tell the user the watcher stopped unexpectedly and do NOT restart.
   - **Zero:** a capture arrived — continue.

3. **Process the record** it printed (see below).

4. **Start the next iteration.** Run `./scripts/watch-once.sh --after <timestamp of the record you just processed>` and go back to step 2.

Always pass `--after <timestamp of the last record you processed>` on the follow-up runs. That makes each run emit the single next capture after that timestamp — returning immediately if one was already waiting while you were busy.

## Process each snapshot

1. The capture record contains `{timestamp, url, title}` plus any of:
  - `screenshot` — object describing a captured PNG, with:
    - `hasHighlights: true` means the user drew red markup (boxes and/or lines) on top of the screenshot to call attention to specific regions.
    - `hasRedactions: true` means the user blacked out at least one region. Those are deliberately hidden as irrelevant or private — don't comment about them unless asked.
    - `isCropped: true` means the PNG covers only a region the user selected.
  - `contents` — object describing a captured whole-page HTML snapshot, with:
    - `isEdited: true` means the user edited the captured HTML before saving, so it didn't come exactly from the website.
  - `selection` — object describing the user's selected text in the page, with:
    - `format` — one of `"html"`, `"text"`, `"markdown"`.
    - `isEdited: true` — same as `contents.isEdited`.
  - `prompt` — the user's instruction for this capture.
  - `imageUrl` — URL of a specific image the user captured, inside the page.
  - `skipInWatcher: true` means the user asked watchers to skip this capture.

  A record may have any subset of `screenshot` / `contents` / `selection`, or none of them (meaning the URL and optional `prompt` are the whole payload).

  Each present artifact also has a `filename` field with an absolute path to the file.

  **Look at referenced files only. Don't go fishing for others unless asked to.**

2. Process the capture:
  - If `screenshot` is present, read the screenshot.
    - **If `screenshot.hasHighlights` is `true`, the user has drawn red markup to call attention to specific regions. Focus your description on those marked areas. If a `prompt` is present, it is likely referring to those regions specifically — interpret it in that context.**
  - If `contents` is present, don't read the file up front (HTML can be large); wait until you know what to look for.
  - If `selection` is present, don't read the file until you know what to look for.
  - **If `prompt` is present, treat it as the user's instruction for this capture and act on it directly.** Use the screenshot, HTML, selection, and/or `url` as the subject of that instruction. If no files were saved, the `url` is what the prompt is about.
  - If `prompt` is absent:
    - For screenshots, briefly describe what you see and mention the source `url`. When `screenshot.hasHighlights` is `true`, lead with what's highlighted.
    - For HTML-only captures, report that you have an HTML snapshot from the source `url` and ask the user what they want to know.
    - For selection-only captures, quote or summarize the selected fragment and mention the source `url`.
    - For URL-only captures (no files), report the `url` and ask the user what they want to know about it.
